Project Summary
Overview
This project appears to be a web-based application focusing on user registration and login functionality. It likely includes front-end components for user interaction and back-end logic for processing and validating user data.

File Descriptions
app.js: The main server file written in Node.js, likely containing the back-end logic, including endpoint definitions, middleware configurations, and server initialization.

signup.html and failure.html: HTML files for the user interface, where signup.html serves as the registration form, and failure.html is probably displayed when registration or login fails.

success.html: An HTML file displayed upon successful user registration or login, welcoming the user or confirming their action.

package.json and package-lock.json: These files are part of Node.js projects, where package.json defines project metadata and dependencies, and package-lock.json ensures consistent installation of dependencies.

System Architecture
Front-end: Comprised of HTML files (signup.html, success.html, failure.html), providing the user interface for registration and feedback on actions.

Back-end: Defined in app.js, handling HTTP requests, user authentication, and responses. It interacts with the front-end through defined endpoints and possibly with a database for storing user data.

Dependencies Management: Managed by package.json and package-lock.json, ensuring the application has all the necessary Node.js packages installed to run correctly.

This summary outlines the project's structure and functionality based on the provided files, offering insight into its overall architecture and components.
